## Quiz Formats

### 1. **Traditional Question-Based Quiz**
This format is a simple, straightforward quiz where the user answers a series of questions. Upon submission, the user's score is displayed.

- **Features**:
  - Questions displayed one at a time.
  - A "Next" button to move to the next question.
  - A "Submit" button on the last question to submit the quiz.
  - Total score is shown after submission.
  - Simple user interface with basic styling.

```html
<!-- Example HTML for Traditional Quiz Format -->
<div class="question-container">
  <h3>What is 2 + 2?</h3>
  <div class="options">
    <input type="radio" name="answer" id="option1" value="3">
    <label for="option1">3</label>
    <input type="radio" name="answer" id="option2" value="4">
    <label for="option2">4</label>
    <input type="radio" name="answer" id="option3" value="5">
    <label for="option3">5</label>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. **MERN Stack Quiz**
This is an advanced format for those who are learning or working with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It integrates backend APIs with frontend interaction to store and manage quiz data dynamically.

- **Features**:
  - Backend powered by Node.js and Express for serving quiz data.
  - Uses MongoDB to store questions and user answers.
  - Can track user progress in real-time.
  - Submissions are stored in a database for future analysis.
  - Integrates React for dynamic frontend rendering.

```javascript
// Example Backend: Node.js Express Endpoint to Fetch Questions
app.get('/api/questions', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('questions').find().toArray((err, questions) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    res.json(questions);
  });
});
```

### 3. **Interactive and Responsive Quiz**
This format focuses on providing a clean, user-friendly, and highly interactive quiz experience. It utilizes **CSS Flexbox** and **JavaScript** to create a responsive layout.

- **Features**:
  - **Interactive Design**: Buttons are styled to change color when clicked. Labels for options change color based on the selection.
  - **Navigation Buttons**: The user can move through the questions with "Previous" and "Next" buttons. On the last question, the "Next" button becomes "Submit."
  - **Pass/Fail Feedback**: After the quiz is submitted, users are given feedback on whether they passed or failed based on the predefined passing threshold.

```html
<!-- Example of Interactive Quiz Styling -->
<style>
  .options label:hover {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  .options input:checked + label {
    background-color: #28a745;
    color: white;
  }
</style>
```
